# ⚡ ZigPapi's Personal Standard Library ⚡

Welcome to my **personal standard library**, crafted by yours truly, **ZigPapi**! This is my evolving collection of **data structures, algorithms**, and other essential utilities that I find useful in my Zig projects. It's a work in progress, but hey, you're welcome to use it, learn from it, or even contribute if you vibe with it.

---

## 🛠 What's Inside?
Right now, I've just started, and the **BST (Binary Search Tree)** is the first feature to land. But don't get comfortable — there’s a ton more coming soon. I’m talking about:
- 🌀 Advanced data structures
- 📚 Optimized algorithms
- 🛡️ Handy utilities I personally can't live without
- 🔧 And anything else I dream up while coding

---

## 🚀 Why ZigPapi's Standard Library?
Zig is already ⚡ fast and efficient, but sometimes you just need that **extra spice**. This library is my playground to experiment, optimize, and create tools that make my life easier as a Zig dev.

---

## 🌟 What's Coming?
- 🌐 Graphs and heaps (because everyone loves a good DSA challenge)
- 🌉 Networking utilities
- 🧠 Memory management tools
- 🌲 More BST and beyond (trust me, the tree's gonna grow)

---

## 🔗 How to Use
Clone the repo and include it in your Zig project. Here's how:
```zig
const std = @import("std");
const ztd = @import("zigpapi/ztd");

pub fn main() !void {
    const tree = ztd.BTS.init();
    // TODO 🌀
}
```
## 🤝 Contributing  
Feel like adding your own flavor? Go for it. Submit a pull request or open an issue — I’m open to ideas, as long as it aligns with the **ZigPapi vision** (read: useful, clean, and creative).  

---

## 💡 Stay Inspired  
I’m building this library for myself, but I’m sharing it for anyone who finds it useful. Zig is about **control, performance, and simplicity**, and I want my library to reflect that.  

Hit that ⭐ if you like what you see. More features and creative tools are on the way!
